## Reflections

### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs requires following best practices, including:

- Modular design
- Proper naming conventions
- Extensive commenting

In this course, the **CRUD Python module** from Project One was crucial in connecting dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. The module's modular structure facilitated seamless integration, ensuring that each function had a single responsibility. This approach simplifies debugging and updating the codebase.

By working this way, we encourage reusability. For instance, the CRUD module can be adapted for future projects that involve database operations such as Create, Read, Update, and Delete. Potential applications include other dashboard systems, report generation tools, or automated data management scripts.

### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
Approaching problems as a computer scientist involves the following steps:

1. Breaking down the problem into manageable components.
2. Applying logical problem-solving techniques.
3. Iterating based on feedback and requirements.

For Grazioso Salvare's database and dashboard requirements, I began by analyzing the client’s specifications and translating them into technical tasks. I prioritized functionality and iteratively refined the database structure to achieve all project goals.

This project was different from previous assignments because it focused on addressing a client’s operational needs in the real world. In future projects, I plan to utilize similar strategies, including:

- User-centered design
- Iterative development
- Testing and validation to ensure client satisfaction

### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists design and implement technology solutions to solve real-world problems, helping organizations operate more efficiently.

My work on this project illustrates how technology can enhance operations for companies like Grazioso Salvare. By developing a robust database and an intuitive dashboard, I provided tools that improve their ability to manage processes, analyze data, and make informed decisions.

This type of work is crucial in a data-driven world, empowering organizations to adapt, increase productivity, and deliver better services to their customers.
